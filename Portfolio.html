In this write-up, I sought to answer whether a survey of mental health benefits of tech industry employees could be
used to cluster employees into groups with good and bad mental health coverage.

In completing this project, I learned how to encode categorical data and create an insightful EDA with great
visualizations. I also learned how to implement clustering methods on data, and analyze the appropriateness of
the clustering method with various techniques.

This project was motivated by my drive to learn about the best practices of predictive modeling in text data.
In the write-up, I cleaned and vectorized Twitter data, visualized and examined patterns, and created a linear
classifier to predict document sentiment with 89% accuracy on a validation set.
