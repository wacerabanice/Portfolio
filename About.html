<h3> About Me </h3>
<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">
<p>
 Hi, my name is Banice and I work remotely as a freelance data scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s
    degree in science (Business Finance, University of Nairobi).<br><br>

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets:
    to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me. <br><br>

I have been working as a data scientist for more than ten years with experience in Finance and Micro Finance.
    I have worked for multinational companies which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into
    understandable insights. <br><br>

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail. <br><br>
